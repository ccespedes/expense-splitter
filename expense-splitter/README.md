# Expense Splitter

## Overview

This app was created to have a convenient way to split the bill between a group of friends. With a focus on smooth UX, we've designed our app to feel intuitive for the user to use and understand.

## Features

**<u>Analytics:</u>**
Our pie charts provide a visual breakdown of expenses by _Friend_ in the _Expense_ view and by _Category_ in the _Group_ view. The progress bar makes it easy to see at first glance, how close everyone is to balance out their accounts.

**<u>Edit:</u>**
Don't have all the info at once? Feel free to _Create Your Expense_ and go back to _Edit_ it anytime. Your saved expense information will dynamically update, including the new total amounts each friend owes.

**<u>Receipt Upload:</u>**
For easier reference, share the receipt in your group with our _Upload_ feature.

**<u>Filtered View Tabs:</u>**
View relevant information by tab for: _Group_, _Friend_, and _Expense_ to focus on what you specifically want access to.

**<u>Summary:</u>**
Our homepage offers a consolidated view of the top three recent activities for _Groups_ and \*Expenses.

**<u>Search:</u>**
An easy to use search bar is accessible on each tab to search for your group, friend, and/or individual expense.
